##### (Working on an Artificial Intelligence model)

**Today's Progress**: I've worked a bit on the NLP (Natural Language Processing) initial phase for my AI model (Model-Ai). I've added to the Transponder logic, and patched some code.

**Thoughts:** I know committing to this challenge is going to make me a better coder. So I'm happy I started on this journey.

### Thursday 13 January, 2022
##### (Working on an Artificial Intelligence model)

**Today's Progress**: I've cleaned up my code a bit and brushed the output. Then I went to work on the Transponder class of the program, and passing values between classes to have the transponder working.

**Thoughts:** It still has a bug I can't figure out quite yet, but I'm sure that the value might be reset somewhere. It is a lot of fun coding daily. I spent about 3 hours today on my project. Which right now is my client. It's a real coding assignment. Yet, I'm willing to learn.

### Saturday 15 January, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)

**Today's Progress**: I did not make much progress today. Well...all the scripts were broken in the Model-Ai. Which was because I had copied everything from Windows to Linux. So I had to fix all the scripts. In the meantime I was trying to figure out why it didn't work. After i had created new script files and copied the original scripts into them, it worked. The reason it broke was because of the Windows ^M character in the scripts (line breaks).
After I was done with that I created a new rollout function for the model which sets permissions. And I've made sure all the Bash scripts now function.
Tomorrow I'm going to create a script which does fixing the scripts automatically, so I don't have to run into this issue again.

**Thoughts:** The Ai model is slowly gathering inertia. I wish today was a little bit more productive.

### Sunday 16 January, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: I worked a bit on the Ai model, linking up the data and math handlers to process data. It's not functional yet though, but the filters work.

Thoughts: I'll have to continue later to fix the processing of data/math, and the overall Ai model.

### Monday 17 January, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)

**Today's Progress**: I created another class for the Ai model that would control devices or operate engines in the completed model.

**Thoughts:** Tired but it was satisfying.

**Link to work:** (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Tuesday 18 January, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)

**Today's Progress**: I fixed several things about the transponder, this time the numbers are correct. Added some bug fixes.

**Thoughts:** It was a short session of coding, still more happy w/ the current status of the code. It still needs a lot of overhaul and major updates. I want the NLP (Natural Language Processing) in place, still need to do some more learning for that.

**Link to work:** (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Wednesday 19 January, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)

**Today's Progress**: Added code for a shorter version of the 'glob' function, using dirent.h.

**Thoughts:** It was also a short session of coding, because I had to fix the server. Probably will spend some more time with the code later tonight. It was a lot of fiddling to get it right, trying out a variety of functions, and matching the directory name for the modular bay, which lacked a trailing '/' sign. Which was confusing.

**Link to work:** (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Thursday 20 January, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)

**Today's Progress**: Added some code to the Ai matrix, then spent time fixing bugs.

**Thoughts:** There still needs to be a lot of work done.

**Link to work:** (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Friday 21 January, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)

**Today's Progress**: Added a database to the Ai model. Now it can both set and get the active and previous row and column.

**Thoughts:** The database still needs some work, mainly the getting and setting of the data, plus getting the data now that the data is being tracked.

**Link to work:** (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Saturday 22 January, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)

**Today's Progress**: Made two commits today. Added an accounting system to the Ai model. Now it can both set and get accounts. Also I've added a course converter, yet it still has to fetch courses online, right now it's still static.

**Thoughts:** The accounting system works. So I'm happy.

**Link to work:** (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Sunday 23 January, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)

**Today's Progress**: Added storing of financial accounts information, and listing negative/positive accounts. The idea is to get the accounting functions for use in office environments.

**Thoughts:** The accounting system works. So I'm still happy.

**Link to work:** (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Monday 24 January, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added some more of the NLP features in preparing dictionaries, and made that into a separate function.

Thoughts: The method still has a nasty off by one error that needs a fix.

Link to work: (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Tuesday 25 January, 2022
#####(Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Fixed yesterday's bug by putting a check in place in the prepare.cpp functions, after some debugging efforts which took nearly an hour. Then fixed a working input to the function.

Thoughts: At least that work is done. Lol.

Link to work: (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Wednesday 26 January, 2022
#####(Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Worked on the accounting and logging of accounts and transactions this morning.

Thoughts: Probably will work more on it later today.

Link to work: (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Thursday 27 January, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Categorized a circle object for later reference in the shapes architecture.

Thoughts: Probably will work more on it later today. Yet, it was funny summarizing all the advantageous measures.

Link to work: (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Friday 28 January, 2022
##### (Working on Dicy-x, a plain-and-simple old Dice Roller)
Today's Progress: Made an Alpha version for a dice roller program, which I started building yesterday.

Thoughts: It's basically functional. So, that's a good thing!

Link to work: (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/dicy_x


### Saturday 29 January, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added ALSA (audio support) for my Ai model (Model-Ai). Right now you have to press (Q,W) keys to play the audio, also it launches a window.

Thoughts: The audio works, however it has no predefined scheme for when to play the audio. Also, I need custom audio files, then I need to edit the code some more so that it does not launch the mixer window.

Link to work: (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Sunday 30 January, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Fixed the audio, so that it no longer pops up an additional window, also doesn't require key presses, and built into a callable function.

Thoughts: The audio works proper.
Link to work: (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Monday 31 January, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: I've added functions for copying and deleting files in the file hierarchy, into the Ai model. Also I've removed a file that was redundant after I moved the content into the AI/AI.H and AI/AI.CPP files.

Thoughts: I still need a better and more reliable method for the AI::cp() and AI::rm() functions than a system() call. Couldn't get the file_copy() method to work from the "filesystem" header file.
Link to work: (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Tuesday 1 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: I've added importing and exporting of accounts. The importing function still needs to be fixed though, which has a bug. Also I've added more sound effects.

Thoughts: I really love the sound effects.
Link to work: (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Wednesday 2 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: I've worked on the Transponder logic for my Ai model (Model-Ai). Right now it will compare a (yet) non-existing score to the ranking of the answers which it gets from 2 dictionaries, which aren't filled yet. Then returns the query to the Transponder.

Thoughts: Slowly it is coming along.
Link to work: (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Thursday 3 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: I've added some more samples of audio to the project, and devised a function to lookup meta queries, yet it did not store them correctly. So later today, or tomorrow I will transform the meta queries to INT data. Also I've added some debugging symbols in the form of strings.

Thoughts: Too bad the meta queries do not work yet. Basically they need to revert INT data to strings, and vice versa... But oh well.
Link to work: (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Friday 4 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: I've worked a bit on the Transponder module, and the meta_queries.cpp. There is still a bug in there. I still have to verify the debugging output.

Thoughts: Storing metaqueries and then retrieving them doesn't work. Need to implement a technique.
Link to work: (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Saturday 5 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: I've tried fixing the bug in the logic for the meta queries, however it keeps popping up no matter what I change, so I asked for some feedback and am now waiting to see if that would solve the issue.

Thoughts: Storing metaqueries and then retrieving them doesn't work. Need to implement a technique.
Link to work: (the github repository): https://github.com/decodewitness/model-ai


### Sunday 6 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Fixing on the Transponder module. Still buggy.

Thoughts: Next approach probably will be vectors.


### Monday 7 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Fixed the transponder. So now it looks up the queries also in reverse from numbers to words.

Thoughts: Actually this session did go pretty smooth.


### Tuesday 8 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added some sanity checks and comments, also drafted the interface for a basic logic for the modules.

Thoughts: Later I will implement more. Also doing courses.


### Wednesday 9 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: I've implemented math tables in the design. Also I've fixed the importing of accounts, but that still doesn't work properly.

Thoughts: Later I will implement more. Also doing courses.


### Thursday 10 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: I've implemented some math functions, also added a basic calculator function.

Thoughts: I'm getting the hang of this daily coding. I actually enjoy coding more. Still I wish I was further in development w/ my model (Model-Ai).


### Friday 11 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: I have added a total and average for the accounts functionality, as well as fixed the importing/exporting of account information. Which all seems to function at the moment.

Thoughts: I love it when things just go smoothly. Hoping that sooner or later I will have a model that behaves exactly how I want.


### Saturday 12 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Fixed the import/export function.

Thoughts: I finally found those bugs.


### Sunday 13 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: The simulation class will take part of a simulation that simulates real world events.

Thoughts: The simulation class will take part of a simulation that simulates real world events.


### Monday 14 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added life cycles to the entities and objects, as well as fixed the bug with not summarizing objects/entities.

Thoughts: I like where this is going.


### Tuesday 15 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added a Vertex class to the project to run in the simulation.

Thoughts: Now I can track Objects and Entities in the simulation too.


### Wednesday 16 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: I worked on the Simulation class, and added a timer for the simulation run, and size limits and enforcement of x, y, z, coordinates. As well as put in place several checks and tidied up the output for the program.

Thoughts: It now reads the time processed for the simulation.


### Thursday 17 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Worked on moving the logic from the comments in the steering.cpp file into the logic that goes into the queries. So now when you do certain commands it will trigger the accordant functions. So, basically added more control to the flow of the program.

Thoughts: I still need to fix the spawning of entities inside the Simulation, as well as moving the request for how many queries to after it authenticates the client.


### Friday 18 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added some functions to the logic mechanics, like banking which has its own menu. So now we have: "simulation", "convert", "convertd", "hash", "killc", "stepping", "rollout", "curl", and "bank" ... as functions represented by logic.

Thoughts: I still still need to fix the spawning of entities inside the Simulation, as well as moving the request for how many queries to after it authenticates the client.


### Saturday 19 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added several commands for the interactive mode, but forgot to do the log.

Thoughts: It's fun to code very early in the morning or late at night.


### Sunday 20 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added logic for the brain or neural net.

Thoughts: Going to implement the neural net based on cavity searching a catalogue and analyze all data.


### Monday 21 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added more logic for the Brain class, and right now it will hit the correct index in the cabinet.

Thoughts: Need to string more logic to have it resemble a neural net.


### Tuesday 22 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Worked on the neural net and made some progress. Downside there is a bug, but I know in what function.
(Updated): Fixed that bug.

Thoughts: It either has something to do with the file access in the sorter() function in nn.cpp, or it has to do that the file closed, or that a variable gets overriden.


### Wednesday 23 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Tried to fix the search function for the neural net to filter the results properly, without relying to external libraries. Made some progress, yet not much.

Thoughts: The sorter does find the article code for the .dat files, yet doesn't do so always. But almost. Likewise sometimes the output misses the definition on some keywords. I'm sure this has to do with the structure of the cabinets for the logic.


### Thursday 24 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Worked on sanitizing the output, and the Brain class.

Thoughts: The sorter does find the article code for the .dat files, yet doesn't do so always. But almost. Likewise sometimes the output misses the definition on some keywords. I'm sure this has to do with the structure of the cabinets for the logic.


### Friday 25 February , 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Worked a bit trying to fix the NLP engine, and right now there are no errors in finding keywords from the cabinets. Worked a bit on the Simulation class which seems to crash when I add Entity class object to the Simulation run.

Thoughts: It is not entirely clear to me why the simulation run is crashing, all I know is that it is related to the Entity object or the sim.


### Saturday 26 February , 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Fixed the crash that happened when allocating Entities to the Simulation run, added label for the sorter() function, that is part of string_logic() to string in further references like: [ai.dat] type of reference. Also I have added a function to display the version number.

Thoughts: Having this fixed I can continue w/ the creating of the indexing variety in the Brain "module" or filter. Then next steps is to assign the recall function, and train the model in accurate responses, once I've created part of the module which already has to have (a larger) an index of sampled input data. This data is in the form of "phrases" or sequences of numbers, which the model couples to key inputs and then train the model in logic. Still this is some considerate amount of time in the coming period.


### Sunday 27 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added a method to manipulate data like Entities and Objects inside of the Simulation run.

Thoughts: It still needs some work, yet it will trigger on the right cycle through the reverse methods triggered in that cycle.


### Monday 28 February, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: I've added a few labels, and added an option to manipulate Objects and Entities during the Simulation run. Added a short listing for the same thing. Added a short handle (/sim) to run the simulation.

Thoughts: Need to make the performance of the manipulate function congruent with desires for functionality of the program.


### Tuesday 1 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: I worked on revising the Simulation model. Still a bit off.

Thoughts: Need to fix the round ending at the right cycle. As well as measuring the correct time and such. And manipulating entities.


### Wednesday 2 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added an option to store to the cabinet for the Brain object class.

Thoughts: Need to finish the round of adding data, so it's more streamlined.


### Thursday 3 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added the /add_data command to store logic inside the cabinets.

Thoughts: I've added the functions but it still has a bug and crashes internally inside the module, and does not store the data in every instance.


### Friday 4 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Fixed the sorter() function problem, and added handling of files with .dat index.

Thoughts: Next I need to add functionality to the .dat files and build further on the neural network.


### Saturday 5 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Worked a bit on the model, yet couldn't finish the thing I was working on. Tried to couple the assemble brain routine to the indexing for the integer values for words in the index, and that to a weights distribution.

Thoughts: I need to get more sleep.


### Sunday 6 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Worked on the Brain class for the Ai model.

Thoughts: I forgot to post this yesterday.


### Monday 7 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Worked on the weights for the model, registering from the Brain class for Ai model.

Thoughts: I'm getting the hang of this.


### Tuesday 8 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Worked on the Brain class for the artificial intelligence project. Cleaned up output, and worked out some bugs.

Thoughts: Probably going to code more tonight on the project. It is satisfying to see it actually is doing what I want.


### Wednesday 9 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Fixed the error with the include_path setting, which didn't do anything to the code, more so for Visual Studio to not display the error in syntax highlighting for missing libraries. Added a Service class, a Robotica class (not implemented), and a Courtesy class to serve as a bot translator between various peers/clients. It has added protocols in the interface.

Thoughts: Still busy. But it's almost bedtime.


### Thursday 10 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Fixed an infinite loop when not hitting the correct search results. Added functions add_intelligence() to the AI object class, and to the Brain object class added add_intel().

Thoughts: Took some debugging but we've managed.


### Friday 11 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Worked on the sorter() method for the Brain nn (neural net) class, basically added some more functional criteria to support additional file access inside a second file logged inside the logical cabinet, inside the "brain/data" directory.

Thoughts: This still needs some work. This seemed easier in school to try and create a neural net based on references.


### Saturday 12 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Worked on the convert_data() method, and added several fixes.

Thoughts: Got really tired so I went to bed.


### Sunday 13 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added functionality to actually convert the data with the /convert_data function. Which still should be indexed. Right now it will only filter interpunctuations.

Thoughts: I have to decide on a format for the filtered data. Which will probably use an analogue function to the prepare_ints() method.


### Monday 14 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: I fixed a bug in the method that filters data in the Brain class. Yet, I discovered another bug presumably in a function that flushes the data, why the program jumps out of its flow.

Thoughts: I have to rewrite that method, which I was planning on anyway.


### Tuesday 15 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Fixed the bug in the /add_data command, but introduced a new unwanted feature where it needs an Enter press to continue, else it won't get the query correctly.

Thoughts: I'll see if I can fix that in the next session, then also handle input/output of the add_data function.


### Wednesday 16 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: I've made progress (twice!)... but the VM keeps crashing... so I will have to reinstall it. Or at least continue w/ a different VM... The first time I lost an hour of coding, and just when I reimplemented that part of code, the VM crashed again. The solves on the Internet don't work, though... thankfully the code is safe in Github.

Thoughts: I guess I'll have to reinstall a VM, which I also had done already today.


### Thursday 17 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added an update responsible for delivering streaming content, or at least a function which takes an URL and downloads videos from YouTube, as extra functionality...

Thoughts: I still need to sanitize the input, because now the program will crash in some special instances when you put in extra keys, because I don't really check for the input as a parameter should get checked.


### Friday 18 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added a few labels to the help, and experienced a slow down when playing audio, so I added a toggle_audio() function. Disabled audio to temporarily save it from the crash, but this is only a temporary solution and could be the VM.

Thoughts: Bug hunting.


### Saturday 19 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added more logic to the shaping neural network.

Thoughts: Going to bed early.


### Sunday 20 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Worked on the Simulation feature. Redoing the simulation feature to make it more concise. Now it will trigger on the manipulated targets accurately.

Thoughts: Probably should increase the "cycle" number by 1, so that I don't have to artificially increase it to do calculations, because it will start from 0.


### Monday 21 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added credential management to the flow. Which you can now change the password, and list hashes from within the model.

Thoughts: It's cool to see this work. I think I need to employ a database though for the production model.


### Tuesday 22 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added a stringCode() function to codify strings. Added a menu() function but that one is still empty, which will generate a control flow for the programmed logic interface for the user.

Thoughts: Coding is awesome.


### Wednesday 23 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Got to working on the drawMenu() a.k.a. ai.menu() and related functions. Added it to the list of commands, and still need to finish the implementation of the menu.

Thoughts: Time flies when coding is amazing.


### Thursday 24 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Tied the Transponder to the input mechanics. Right now it get initialized correctly.

Thoughts: The Transponder still needs to store the int values correctly in another pair of files.


### Friday 25 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Created the mechanism which stores the meta queries sequences, so that I could potentially train the model with responses.

Thoughts: The stored meta queries will be int sequence, that can process much faster with the 20k word list in memory.


### Saturday 26 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Created a function for using vectors for the metaqueries.

Thoughts: Still have to test it.


### Sunday 27 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Fixed the meta queries to read back and translate from query to a string.

Thoughts: Still have to get the bug out which makes the program crash. But I bet it's a size limit.


### Monday 28 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Fixed the crash on the third cycle by omitting a function. Added meta query relations, added to the help function, added to logic.

Thoughts: Analytics in transponder isn't performing adequately.


### Tuesday 29 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Enhanced the meta queries sequence. Added function for writing relations to the relations database.

Thoughts: Still need to fix/test relations.


### Wednesday 30 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added more logic. Fixed the reading of meta query sequences.

Thoughts: Need to fix the relations.


### Thursday 31 March, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added a function to critique scores from user input for known references called scores().

Thoughts: Need to finish this function.


### Friday 1 April, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Moved the files from the Brain class to the Transponder class. Also sanitized input.

Thoughts: Need to finish this function.


### Saturday 2 April, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Got the Transponder working now with a score based system of the best responses, and tracking conversation. Still not the end result but what an untrained model will stripe off in a conversation.

Thoughts: Need to finish this function. Next it will need training, a training method, and input. Then to filter the synonyms and such from the conversation to filter out appropriate responses. Then fill the model with conversations to weed through in its response.


### Sunday 3 April, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added methods to look up the synonyms for the queries, these need to add additional weights to the function and method of looking up queries from the string, yet not based on the Transponder string but on the Query string.

Thoughts: Whew!


### Monday 4 April, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Moved the scores and synonym function to the Transponder class, at the same time broke the synonyms, which needed fixing anyway.

Thoughts: Sheibes!


### Tuesday 5 April, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Fixed the Transponder queries (again).

Thoughts: Next it actually has to incorporate synonyms in assigning the weights to the queries, after that it has to store the weights and dialogues. So then I can train the model.

Today's Progress: Fixed a missing reset of a counter in the Transponder queries which resulting in abnormal behavior.

Thoughts: Next it actually has to incorporate synonyms in assigning the weights to the queries, after that it has to store the weights and dialogues. So then I can train the model.


### Thursday 7 April, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added the methods to export the backlogs of the transponder queries as well as the queries backlogs of the user's input.

Thoughts: Still have to manage the synonyms in the Transponder logic, which needs to be full duplex.


### Friday 8 April, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added relations to the workflow. Now it will keep track of relations of the numbers in the Transponder queries from "trivia_logic" && "questions_answers".

Thoughts: I need to still store these relations, and draw logic from them, based also on interpretation, meaning, and synonyms.


### Saturday 9 April, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Added storing relations. The model will now store the relations in a file, so we can keep track of relations.

Thoughts: I still need to draw logic from there, based also on interpretation, meaning, and synonyms. As well as make the Transponder run on every word in the queries, then seek relations and give a Transponder query. Then develop a method to train the model, and train it to have a fully fledged Ai based of language input/output.


### Sunday 10 April, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Created a structure to store references for the natural language processing, and a method to read stored references and assign them back to a structure. This so we will be able to train the model later.

Thoughts: I still need to test the added methods and such, and then I need to draw logic from there, based also on interpretation, meaning, and synonyms. As well as make the Transponder run on every word in the queries, then seek relations and give a Transponder query. Then develop a method to train the model, and train it to have a fully fledged Ai based of language input/output.


### Monday 11 April, 2022
##### (Working on Model-Ai, an artificial intelligence project)
Today's Progress: Tested and debugged the nref sequences, which are now stored correctly and read correctly back from the file. Allowing for storage of linked concepts, which still need a mechanism for indexing.

Thoughts: Need to add indexing of references (nrefs). I still need to test the added methods and such, and then I need to draw logic from there, based also on interpretation, meaning, and synonyms. As well as make the Transponder run on every word in the queries, then seek relations and give a Transponder query.
