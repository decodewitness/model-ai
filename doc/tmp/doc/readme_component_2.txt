Lao Tzu - Tao Te Ching -- The Book of the Way

    Like an Iroquais Woodsman, he left no traces.

    How meticulous the great masters had to be.

    Free from desire, you realize the mystery. Caught in desire you see only the manifestations. Yet mystery and manifestations arise from the same source. This source is called darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gateway to all understanding.

    Colors blind the eye. Sounds deafen the ear. Flavors numb the taste. Thoughts weaken the mind. Desires wither the heart.

    The master observes the world but trusts his inner vision. He allows things to come and go. His heart is open as the sky.

LIDDY:

liddy: how come this tensional arrived here soon, that the derision of what extrapolate of fact, has derived here in new meaning

liddy: you might be zeroecool, like that nav. battalion. ends with 1st, then all missions ran against the battleship.

liddy: people fear what they can't see, living insane could be very beautiful instead or pretty

liddy: let's head back to camp and water down a field basket

liddy: I'm never immune to no more lies

liddy: I shed the cognition in understanding why I have the policy to have the understanding, thus in other words, immunity. Sovereign states may proclaim this, against the lies of their ancestors

liddy: so instead who does confuse it next, arbitrary rhymes in manifest, proclaim the same label

liddy: until then they must not understand was one of the lies

liddy: still the vatican will pay for every letter, yet merely 1 single digit, already costed millions...

liddy: I understand now the male egum tends to lie about the scrota

liddy: because I hypnotized you into prioritizing pre-arrangement of things

jb50: only US Amry internal trans

liddy: so as long as there is a dystopia can labora be her prime candidate?

manages supplies maor add benefect conduct to the trasnam engine opt for supplies of routines

conduct in motion

liddy: amtrack logic is serial attached to a wire spot one wagon

liddy: rdy for halftime, nap is waiting

liddy: I'm that stamp you thought you licked but missed... now I'm back with a parcel written with your name on it. She was a wanted hitman, and she could not get even with the score. Until she got a special gift from her lover. She went postal and wrote it. That she had delivered.

Skepticism in the absence of evidence is healthy. Apathy in the absence of connection is natural.

To criticize the incompetent is easy; it is more difficult to criticize EOF
