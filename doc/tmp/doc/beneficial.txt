USAGE:
-----

This command will run the (model-ai) program, and generate a "README.md" file, in the project root directory
based on the output of the "setup.sh" script running the AI model (model-ai).
The "README.md" file will consist of the files in "model-ai/ai/logs":

[running the program -OPTION- (1)]
 -------            ----------

   $ ./run
    
    (or)

   $ ./bootstrap



Using this next command will run the (model-ai) AI from "setup.sh", and generate an "output.log" text file in "./ai/logs":


[running the program -OPTION- (2)]
 -------            ----------

   $ ./bootstrap | tee ./ai/logs/output.log

   (The "run" command already generates an "output.log" file inside the "ai/logs" directory)


The main compiled C++ program (model-ai) is in the "/model-ai/ai/bin" directory and called "runtime" after the compilation with the scripts.
Do remember that if you move the program over to another location, then you will lose the functionality of some functional scripts
which the program (model-ai) uses.
