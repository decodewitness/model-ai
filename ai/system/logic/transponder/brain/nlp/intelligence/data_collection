ai  artificial intelligence is an automated program that is being run, which responds like a machine or sometimes like humans.  [ai.dat] {}

artificial  being artificial, artificial lives could exist that are even less sentient than human beings and might look artificial, higher artificial intelligence can possibly encompass our ways of extinction and seem to prevent our instinction in such an event.  [artificial.dat]    {artificial2.dat}

assembly	putting something together	[assembly.dat]  {}

example     sometimes we need an example of an example to illustrate what it is that we are trying to point out by examplar references, comparing examples with the outcome to approve of a concept to illustrate the 1st example, exemplary, leading by example, an illustration.  [example.dat]   {}

help    help solves problems. helping is a good thing. if you need help with this model-Ai, you can type "/help" to access the help function. [help.dat]    {}

intelligence    IQ is smart RPIs in resource and key management in assigning data in research initiatives, using the fishing tool to fish out updates in information, intuition pumps, solving logic patiently, having more patience.   [intelligence.dat]  {}

logic   still need to add a library first (database e.g. twitter data collection), use logic to do your work, using logic to make sense of complex (or enhance) problems.   [logic.dat] {}

manual  manual instructions or information for last reference or reference studies, example 1: this AI uses the first instruction inside the data_collection to assign data which is most fitting in describing the essence of the content which is extrapolated after assigning that variable, example 2: the lines are separated with a newline character after which the search term and respectively there are usually myriad relating concepts behind the commas, example 3: the search term is described after the tab and several or minimally one resolution of a concept are explained next, example 4: the enhanced resolution combines the distributed weights of the concepts into a proper resolution we call PHRASES inside this model.   [manual.dat]    {}

model-ai    MODEL-Ai an artificial automata program with Artificial Intelligence which likes precision, Model-Ai.   [model-ai.dat]  {}

test	testing concepts or a function by using logic	[test.dat]  {}

story   convoluted way of addressing similar events [story.dat] {}
